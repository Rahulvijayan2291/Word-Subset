I’ve just uploaded a detailed solution for the Word Subsets problem, a popular question asked in MAANG interviews. This problem involves checking if words in one list are "universal" based on the combined character requirements of all the words in another list. 🧩

🔧 Solution Highlights:
  - Efficiently handles word frequency counts using a target array.
  - Time complexity: O(A + B).
  - Step-by-step solution with clear explanations for better understanding.

💬 You can find the full code and detailed explanation in the README file.
